# Multi-Resolution Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition

This repository contains the code to replicate the experiments of the paper *"Multi-Resolution Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition"*. It is organized as follows:
* ```data```: contains the two data sources used in the experiments.
* ```results```: contains the three pictures with the results of the experiments.
* ```utils.py```: some tensor ancillary functions.
* ```test_aminoacids.py```: code to obtain Fig. 1 of the paper.
* ```test_video.py```: code to obtain Fig. 2 of the paper.
* ```test_function.py```: code to obtain Fig. 3 of the paper.
